As clouds drift across the screen, laden with pepperoni, mushrooms, and more, players must deftly maneuver their pizza dough to catch the falling ingredients and complete orders. With its charming graphics, fast-paced gameplay, and mouthwatering fun, CWACOP promises an entertaining experience for players of all ages.

# Project Unique Features
Cloudy with a Chance of Pizza is a classic 'dropper' game with a twist. The quintissential process of pizza-making is given an air of whimsy through falling toppings and retro style graphics designed in-house by graphic designer Laurel. Besides being aesthetically pleasing, our graphics are also highly precise, and feature pixel-perfect collision between the toppings and pizza. We feature a simple monetary system that encourages order accuracy and repeat play-ability. An accurately filled order will be rewarded with a tip, while a botched order will result in nothing. At the end of the game, the player is given their accrued money as a type of score, enhancing the play experience and encouraging improvement.
