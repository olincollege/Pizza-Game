# Pizza-Game
## Project Description
Cloudy With A Chance Of Pizza is a lively arcade video game where players take on the role of a pizza chef. As clouds drift across the screen, laden with pepperoni, mushrooms, and more, players must deftly maneuver their pizza dough to catch the falling ingredients and complete orders. We coded this game entirely in python using the pygame library, as we had spent the entire semester leading up to this project taking a software class taught in Python. As of now, our game is functional, but the gameplay is not  intuitive for the user. We hope to implement a better UI that allows the user more time to understand the point of the game before getting thrown into the rapid pizza action.

## Installing and running project
 Our game can be downloaded off of github.com, in our repository called Pizza-Game. The website associated with our game, (https://legendary-telegram-wop7vvr.pages.github.io/), also offers in-depth instructions on how to properly run the game. First, ensure that the Python module Pygame is installed. Instructions on this can be found in the start official Pygame 'Getting Started' reference material: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted. Then, run the 'main.py' file included within the repository files. This will allow for a full play-through of the game.
